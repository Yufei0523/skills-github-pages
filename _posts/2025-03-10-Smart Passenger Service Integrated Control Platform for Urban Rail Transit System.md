## **Smart Passenger Service Integrated Control Platform for Urban Rail Transit System**

![Project1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/1.jpg)

The **Smart Passenger Service Integrated Control Platform** is an advanced system designed to provide urban rail transit staff with real-time monitoring and control over various components of the metro station. By integrating technologies such as **Vue.js**, **Spring Boot**, **MySQL**, **MyBatis**, and connecting with interfaces like **broadcast**, **camera monitoring**, and **PIS** (Passenger Information System), this platform aims to make station operations more efficient and user-friendly.

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-time Monitoring**  
The platform provides real-time monitoring of the metro stationâ€™s various systems, including broadcasting, CCTV, and the PIS. This allows operators to quickly identify any issues or irregularities within the station.

### 2. **Integration with Multiple Systems**  
The platform integrates with existing metro infrastructure, including:
- **Broadcasting Systems**: For announcements and public address services.
- **Camera Surveillance**: For video feeds and monitoring the station.
- **Passenger Information Systems (PIS)**: To provide passengers with up-to-date information on arrivals, departures, and other station-related announcements.

### 3. **Intuitive User Interface (UI)**  
Built using **Vue.js**, the platform provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows operators to easily navigate and control various aspects of the station's operations. It simplifies tasks like viewing camera feeds, making announcements, and monitoring PIS displays.

### 4. **Efficient Data Management**  
Backend services are powered by **Spring Boot** with **MySQL** and **MyBatis**. This ensures smooth handling of large volumes of data generated by various systems in the station, like passenger information, video surveillance data, and broadcasting logs.

### 5. **Centralized Control**  
Operators can control multiple devices and systems from a single centralized platform, improving coordination and reducing response time during emergencies or routine operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:  
  - **Vue.js**: Used to build the user interface and manage dynamic content on the platform.
  
- **Backend**:  
  - **Spring Boot**: Powers the backend services and handles the business logic.
  - **MySQL**: Used to store and manage all relational data like user information, system logs, and station metrics.
  - **MyBatis**: Simplifies database operations and interaction with the MySQL database.

- **System Integrations**:  
  - **Broadcast Systems**: Integration for making station announcements.
  - **CCTV Monitoring**: Live video streaming and event logging.
  - **Passenger Information Systems (PIS)**: Displays station and train information to passengers in real-time.

## Architecture

1. **Frontend (Vue.js)**:  
   The user interface built with Vue.js allows real-time updates and responsive design, making it easier for station operators to interact with the platform on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.

2. **Backend (Spring Boot + MySQL + MyBatis)**:  
   The backend is powered by Spring Boot for handling APIs and business logic, MySQL for storing and retrieving station data, and MyBatis for simplifying database interaction.

3. **System Integration**:  
   - **Broadcast System**: Allows operators to send announcements and public address information.
   - **CCTV System**: Provides video feeds for real-time monitoring and surveillance.
   - **PIS Integration**: Displays real-time passenger information across screens in the station.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the management of station operations, reducing the time it takes to respond to incidents and ensuring that the station runs s
